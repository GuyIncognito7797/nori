## About
Nori is a free and open source Android image search client with support for various third-party APIs.

### About this Fork ###
Basically, I got bored of the app slowly dying as different APIs changed and have decided to fix it
myself.

### Download ###
If you wish to get it directly from us, we publish APKs for each release on
[GitHub](https://github.com/jwilliams9707/nori/releases).
